## Existing Metadata

During the historical imagery scanning process the following metadata fields are populated

|Field Name|Definition|Comments|Examples|STAC|
|-|-|-|-|-|
|sufi|unique identifier for every negative (generated by LINZ when adding to the database)||000001 to 600000+|id|
|survey|number assigned to each scheduled aerial flight; typically, there is a flight chart available showing the layout of the survey over a location|<p>either this or alternate_survey_name becomes part of the filename</p><p>Always included</p>|123; 4567; CAA1012||
|run|a straight line/pass of sequential imagery flown during a specific survey (plane makes one run, turns around and comes back on a new run)|<p>part of filename if available</p><p>but might be missing</p>|1, 2, 3; A, B, C|historical_imagery:run|
|photo_no|sequential order of photos taken during a run|<p>part of filename if available</p><p>but might be missing</p>|1, 2, 3, 4|historical_imagery:photo_number|
|alternate_survey_name|assumed survey number for negatives that appear to be associated with a survey but were not a part of the survey as listed on the chart (extra frames or test images, etc.)|<p>either this or survey becomes part of the filename</p>|123; 456; CAA1012|historical_imagery:alternate_survey_name|
|camera|camera model used to take the photos|<p>but might be missing</p>|Wild RC5; Zeiss RMK 60-23|instrument|
|camera_sequence_no|also referred to as the veder; sequential order of photos taken by an individual camera (usually 5-6 digits because cameras would take tens of thousands over the lifespan of their usage; there will be some duplication in these numbers because each new camera starts again at 1 when brand new)|<p>useful for identify the negative when doing metadata</p><p>often missing</p>|33410; 199101|historical_imagery:instrument_sequence_number|
|nominal_focal_length|distance in mm from the camera lens centre to the film in the camera at which the image will have the least possible distortion|<p>necessary for some high-tech photo analysis measuring change in images</p><p>might be missing</p>|210; 114|historical_imagery:nominal_focal_length|
|altitude|altitude in feet at which the plane was flying when the photo was taken|<p>necessary for analysis of measurements in images and calculating scale</p>|5000; 16500|historical_imagery:altitude|
|scale|denominator of distance on the ground relative to distance on the physical film negative for a photo (1:63,360 is 1 inch = 1 mile)||44500|historical_imagery:scale|
|photocentre_lat|latitude of the estimated centre point of the photo|<p>often missing</p>|-37.9128||
|photocentre_lon|longitude of the estimated centre point of the photo|<p>often missing</p>|178.2355||
|date|date on which the photo was taken|<p>necessary for photo context</p><p>occasionally missing on extra frames</p>|1958-01-23 00:00:00|datetime|
|film|identification number assigned by NZAM to each roll of film held in their storage (films are long rolls of multiple surveys; each strip of negatives will be taped to each other end on end)|<p>only of use to us in tracking and locating original negatives</p>|996; 2510C; CAA22|historical_imagery:film_id|
|film_sequence_no|sequential order of each negative within a roll of film||234, 4567|historical_imagery:file_sequence_no|
|photo_type|whether the negative is black/white or colour|<p>easy to tell from looking at image</p>|B&amp;W; COLOUR|historical_imagery:photo_color|
|format|physical size of the negatives on a roll of film|<p>useful in research and necessary for calculating scale</p>|23 cm x 23 cm; 18 cm x 23 cm|historical_imagery:film_physical_size|
|source|whether the scan is of an original negative or a copy|<p>useful for our records of the source material</p>|ORIGINAL; COPY|historical_imagery:is_original|
|physical_film_condition|arbitrary comments field about unusual film condition (became a catch all for any random comments not related to what is seen in the photo)|<p>useful for our records but lots of random comments</p>|Film scratched; Metadata manually populated; Not Film 222|historical_imagery:film_condition|
|image_anomalies|arbitrary comments about usual things noticed in the negative (cloud shadows on the ground, smoke in the air, sun glare)|<p>mainly for our records and often incorrectly contains physical film problems</p>|Cloud shadow; Fogging present|historical_imagery:film_anomalies|
|scanned|whether the negative has been scanned or not|<p>if the image is in the Data Lake it has been scanned; mainly for our records during the scanning process</p>|Yes; [null]||
|raw_filename|filename assigned by WSP when they scan a negative and provide us the image (this never changes)|<p>will never be seen by anyone except us for identifying backups</p>|<p>NZAM_486_038</p><p><br></p><p>CROWN_1451_274</p>|Asset Location|
|released_filename|renamed filename assigned by LINZ for easier identification based on Survey/Run/Photo No (currently also mentions the collection but this will be removed at some point)|<p>necessary for identifying the file from the metadata; will always be included</p>|NZAM_399_K_25|Asset Location|
|when_scanned|Year and quarter during which the photo was scanned/delivered to us (deliveries are on a monthly basis; Q1 Jan-Mar, Q2 Apr-Jun, etc.)|<p>potentially useful for locating backups</p>|2020/Q1|historical_imagery:scanned_datetime|
|shape|EWKB of the bbox extent|||
|photo_version|Unsure what this field is, I assume it has to do with photos that were re-flown due to cloud cover or another anomaly, and thus we may have two variant copies of the same survey/run/photo no, but Iâ€™m not 100% sure about this|may be needed to flag multiple versions of an image</p>|1; 2|historical_imagery:photo_version|
